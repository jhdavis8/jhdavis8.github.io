I am a senior undergraduate computer science student at the [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/) and prospective PhD student for Fall 2021. I plan to graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science as well as a B.A. in Philosophy and minor in Mathematics in May 2021.

Broadly, I am interested in the intersection of high-performance computing with formal methods and programming languages. Computational scientists depend on useful programming abstractions for complex underlying computational technologies to squeeze fast, correct performance out of modern supercomputers. I plan to develop improvements to existing programming models and tools that interact with these models to tackle challenges in performance portability and correctness in HPC, particularly those facing deep learning workloads.

Currently, I work with the [Computational Research and Programming Lab](https://crpl.cis.udel.edu/) and the [Verified Software Lab](http://vsl.cis.udel.edu/) at UD on projects related to these topics. First and foremost, I am a developer for the [SOLLVE OpenMP V&V test suite](https://github.com/SOLLVE/sollve_vv), part of the Exascale Computing Project (ECP). To see the latest results from the V&V suite, check out [our website](https://crpl.cis.udel.edu/ompvvsollve/results/). My second main project at the moment is automatically formally verifying data structures from [<i>The Art of Multiprocessor Programming</i>](https://www.elsevier.com/books/the-art-of-multiprocessor-programming/herlihy/978-0-12-415950-1), using [CIVL](http://vsl.cis.udel.edu/civl/). The source code for that project can be found [here](https://github.com/jhdavis8/amp-ver).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
